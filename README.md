# Code Description

This repository contains Python scripts that perform various tasks. Below is a brief overview of each script:

## Question 1
- Calculates statistics (minimum, maximum, median, average, and range) from a list of ages.
- Manipulates lists and performs basic arithmetic operations.

## Question 2
- Demonstrates dictionary manipulation by creating dictionaries for a dog and a student.
- Performs operations like accessing values, adding new key-value pairs, and extracting keys and values as lists.

## Question 3
- Shows manipulation of tuples by combining, finding lengths, and adding elements.
- Demonstrates basic tuple operations such as concatenation and finding the length.

## Question 4
- Illustrates set operations like union, intersection, difference, subset, and disjoint.
- Shows conversion of lists to sets and compares lengths.

## Question 5
- Calculates the area and circumference of a circle given the radius.
- Accepts user input for the radius and computes the area of the circle.

## Question 6
- Splits a sentence into words, finds unique words, and calculates the count of unique words.

## Question 7
- Prints information using tab-separated values, simulating tabular data.

## Question 8
- Computes the area of a circle with a given radius and displays the result using string formatting.

## Question 9
- Reads weights of students in pounds from the user, converts them to kilograms, and prints the results.

Each script addresses a specific problem and provides a solution using Python programming constructs.
